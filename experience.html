<p><center>99 speedmart is where I worked for three months after finishing SPM. I work as a cashier. 
Not only that, I also have to carry out other work such as stocking new items, making a planogram and others.
It was an interesting experience for me. When I know how hard and tiring it is to work, I understand my parents feelings better.
But all my hard work is paid off. I used my salary money to cover my study expenses. I hope this can reduce the burden of my parents.

<p><center>When I initially started working after school, it was at Sakan. But then I was offered another employment, so I only worked here for a little while.
Working here is a very exhausting experience, especially considering that I was working during ramadhan. 
But because I have wonderful pals all around me, my workplace is a lot of fun.</p></center>

<p><center>PTDI PG is the place where I did my internship. The duration of the internship is two months. 
During my time here, I gained a lot of expertise, such as how to make stocktakes and catalogue. I'm having a great time here.
